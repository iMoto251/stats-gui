# MX Simulator Automatic Statistics Generator

Very **very** rough, but funcitonal, statistics generator for Mx Simulator in raceFactory Gaming series. It utilizes a web scraper built in JavaScript to write to an output text file in BBCode format. I haven't had time to update anything or slim down the code, so funcitonality should work, but may be limited or need slight changes.

## Web Scraper
The web scraper is built utilizing puppeteer.

## GUI
The GUI is in HTML and CSS packed by electron.

## Upcoming projects
- MSI installer to install the program and all dependencies for ease of use.
- Add EMF series
- Update GUI to be more user friendly
- Automatically grab series race URL's from qualifying URL
- Chrome extension?
